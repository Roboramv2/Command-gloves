# Command gloves

Project to create a glove/a pair of gloves that can be used in several other projects as control input. Combinations of movements of individual fingers are used for controlling parameters of other projects. For example: lifting the index finger increases the brightness of the lights.

### Prototype glove:
Arm band designed out of an old sock. Flex sensors I made at home in another project, are used here to read my finger movement. Fingers supported with loops made of old ribbons.
